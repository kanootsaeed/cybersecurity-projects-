### Password Cracker with John the Ripper

---

### üîé Overview
This project demonstrates the use of **John the Ripper**, an industry-standard password cracking tool, to highlight the risks of weak passwords.  
By simulating a small cracking exercise inside a controlled environment, I show how attackers can recover plaintext passwords from hashes when weak wordlists are used.  

This lab reinforces the importance of strong password policies, salted/slow hashing algorithms, and multi-factor authentication.

### üñ•Ô∏è Environment Setup
- **Host Machine:** macOS (Apple Silicon)  
- **Virtualization:** UTM (QEMU-based hypervisor for ARM)  
- **Guest OS:** Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (ARM64)  
- **Tool Used:** John the Ripper

### ‚öôÔ∏è Lab Steps

### Step 1 ‚Äî Install John the Ripper
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y john
john --version
```

### Step 2 ‚Äî Create a Small Wordlist

**Why we do this:**  
Attackers rarely guess passwords randomly. Instead, they rely on *wordlists* ‚Äî collections of the most common passwords people use.  
For this lab, I created a **tiny custom wordlist** with just a few weak examples to simulate this process.

**Command:**
```bash
cat << 'EOF' > wordlist.txt
password
Password123
qwerty
letmein
admin123
Qwerty123!
EOF

# Quick check
wc -l wordlist.txt && head -n 5 wordlist.txt
```
