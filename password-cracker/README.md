### Password Cracker with John the Ripper

---

### üîé Overview
This project demonstrates the use of **John the Ripper**, an industry-standard password cracking tool, to highlight the risks of weak passwords.  
By simulating a small cracking exercise inside a controlled environment, I show how attackers can recover plaintext passwords from hashes when weak wordlists are used.  

This lab reinforces the importance of strong password policies, salted/slow hashing algorithms, and multi-factor authentication.
