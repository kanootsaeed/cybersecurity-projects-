# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Projects

This repository contains a collection of hands-on labs and projects that simulate real-world cybersecurity concepts, tools, and defensive strategies.  
Each project is documented thoroughly with commands, screenshots, explanations, and analysis — designed to demonstrate both technical execution and analytical reasoning.

## 📑 Projects

### 1. [Cowrie SSH/Telnet Honeypot](honeypot-cowrie/README.md)  
- Deployed Cowrie, a medium-interaction honeypot, inside a virtualized Ubuntu environment.  
- Captures SSH and Telnet login attempts, credentials, and attacker interactions.  
- Validates functionality by simulating adversary activity and analyzing logs.  

*(More projects will be added — IDS/IPS, SOC log analysis, threat hunting labs, etc.)*  

2. Password Cracker with John the Ripper

- Installed and configured **John the Ripper** on Ubuntu VM for password cracking demonstrations.
- Created a small custom **wordlist** of common passwords.
- Generated SHA-256 hashes from known test passwords.
- Used John the Ripper to crack the hashes and displayed results.
- Analyzed why weak passwords are easily broken and the importance of strong password policies.

## 🎯 Objective  

The goal of this repository is to serve as a **technical portfolio of cybersecurity projects** — combining foundational security engineering practices with hands-on experimentation.  
This demonstrates capabilities across:  

- Endpoint and network monitoring  
- Incident detection and response  
- Threat intelligence application  
- Log analysis and SIEM integration  
- Adversary emulation and honeypotting
