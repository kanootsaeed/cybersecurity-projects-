### Cowrie SSH/Telnet Honeypot  

### üîé Overview  
This project sets up a **Cowrie** honeypot (fake SSH/Telnet server) to observe attacker behavior. I show how raw logs become analyst-friendly tables, add a real detection rule for brute force, and include a small SOC playbook for triage and escalation decisions.

### Detection & Response

**What I detect**
- **R1 (MED):** ‚â•10 failed SSH logins from the same `src_ip` within 5 minutes (brute-force threshold)
- **R2 (HIGH):** any successful login to the Cowrie honeypot

**Portable rules (Sigma)**
- Threshold rule: [`detections/ssh_bruteforce_sigma.yml`](detections/ssh_bruteforce_sigma.yml)
- Success rule:   [`detections/ssh_success_sigma.yml`](detections/ssh_success_sigma.yml)

**R1 (threshold)**
- Query:

- Threshold: **by `src_ip` ‚â• 10** in **5 minutes**

**R2 (scheduled query)**

### üõ†Ô∏è Environment Setup  

- **Host Machine:** macOS (Apple Silicon)  
- **Virtualization:** [UTM](https://mac.getutm.app/) (QEMU-based hypervisor for ARM)  
- **Guest OS:** Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (ARM64)  
- **Honeypot Software:** Cowrie (Python3-based)  

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation Steps  

#### 1. System Update  
After installing Ubuntu, updated and upgraded system packages:  

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```
![Step 1](./screenshots/01-system-update.png)

#### 2. Install Required Dependencies  

Cowrie requires Python3, Git, and several supporting libraries.  

```bash
sudo apt install -y git python3 python3-venv python3-dev libssl-dev libffi-dev build-essential authbind less
```
![step 2](./screenshots/02-install-dependencies.png)

#### 3. Create a Dedicated User for Cowrie

Create a non-privileged user account for running Cowrie:

```bash
sudo adduser --disabled-password cowrie
```
You will be prompted to enter user details (Full Name, Room Number, etc.).
Press ENTER to accept the defaults, or enter placeholder values if you prefer.
![step 3](./screenshots/03-create-cowrie-user.png)

#### 4. Clone the Cowrie Repository  

Switch to the `cowrie` user and clone the official Cowrie repository from GitHub:  

```bash
su - cowrie
git clone https://github.com/cowrie/cowrie.git
cd cowrie
```
![step 4](./screenshots/04-clone-cowrie-repo.png) 

#### 5. Create and Activate Python Virtual Environment  

Cowrie should be installed inside a virtual environment to keep dependencies isolated.  

```bash
python3 -m venv cowrie-env
source cowrie-env/bin/activate
```
![step 5](./screenshots/05-setup-venv.png)

#### 6. Install Python Dependencies

Cowrie requires several Python libraries. Install all dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
After installation, verify the packages with:
```
pip list
```
![step 6](./screenshots/06-install-pip-dependencies.png) 

#### 7. Configure Cowrie

Copy the default configuration file to create your own working `cowrie.cfg` file:

```bash
cp etc/cowrie.cfg.dist etc/cowrie.cfg
```
Verify the file exists in the etc/ directory:
```
ls -la etc/
```
![step 7](./screenshots/07-configure-cowrie.png)

#### 8. Start and Verify Cowrie

Start the Cowrie honeypot using the provided script:

```bash
bin/cowrie start
```
Then check its status to confirm it is running:
```
bin/cowrie status
```
![step 8](./screenshots/08-start-cowrie.png)
![step 8](./screenshots/08-verify-status.png)

#### 9. Monitor Cowrie Logs

Cowrie stores logs in the `var/log/cowrie/` directory. These logs capture all SSH/Telnet connection attempts, authentication attempts, and commands executed by attackers.

List the contents of the log directory:

```bash
ls -la var/log/cowrie/
```
Then use tail -f to monitor the log file in real-time:
```
tail -f var/log/cowrie/cowrie.log
```
![step 9](./screenshots/09-monitor-logs.png)

#### 10. Simulate Attack Attempts

To validate that Cowrie is functioning, attempt to connect via SSH.  
Remember, Cowrie listens on **port 2222** by default, not the standard port 22. 

```bash
ssh test@192.168.x.x -p 2222
```
![step 10](./screenshots/10-simulated-attack.png)

When testing, you will see failed login attempts captured in the logs. This confirms that the honeypot is intercepting and recording activity exactly as expected.
In a real-world deployment, attackers scanning your network would hit this service, allowing you to analyze their behavior in a safe and controlled environment.
