# Cowrie SSH/Telnet Honeypot  

## üîé Overview  
This project demonstrates the deployment and configuration of **Cowrie**, a medium-interaction SSH/Telnet honeypot. The honeypot is designed to emulate a vulnerable system, attract attackers, and capture their behavior in a controlled environment.  

By setting this up, I simulated how adversaries attempt to connect to exposed SSH services and captured the logs of their login attempts and commands. This is a foundational project for developing skills in intrusion detection, log analysis, and adversary emulation.
